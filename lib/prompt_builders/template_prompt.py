    Template function for creating a custom prompt builder.

    This example shows the expected structure: the function accepts a single
    dataset row and returns a string prompt. You can replace the body with
    your own logic to format the row into the instruction or question you
    want the model to see.

    Use this as a scaffold to ensure consistency across custom builders.
